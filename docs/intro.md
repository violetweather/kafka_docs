# Introduction

:::info
The following documentation covers all the information for Kangel's v1.xx update codenamed **Kafka**.
:::

**Kangel** is a proprietary TypeScript Discord bot built using [Sapphire](https://sapphirejs.dev) and [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org).

She doesn't work like the other bots, with a gacha system promoting original characters, a *Tamagotchi-like* system inspired by **NEEDY STREAMER OVERLOAD**, and many utilities that users can take advantage of.
