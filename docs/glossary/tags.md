# Tags

### Definition
The Tag system allows users to create a label or flag, within a guild, that responds with user content without the use of slash commands. This system handles interactions between the database and commands seamlessly, there is no step where we can see the tag information.

### Trigger a tag
With the `.` prefix and name appended to it, the bot will respond with the assigned user content.
