# Bot Moderators

### Definition
**Bot Moderators** are handpicked moderators to handle reports and possibly exploit issues with Kangel. They are tasked with the responsibility to remove reviews, block users from the bot, and more.

### Reports
If a report is sent for a review, these moderators are able to see `Author Name`, `Star Rating` and the `Review Comment` from the review ID that was reported. All data that moderators can access is strictly through moderation commands that fetch IDs. By default, the bot will send reports to a private channel that these moderators can see.

### Kangel Accounts
Moderators can place Kangel accounts in the **[K-Block](/docs/glossary/k-block)** list, these accounts can only be found with the use of userIDs.
